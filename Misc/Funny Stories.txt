Not fair I have too many.  

* Work at Fortune 500 company.  Late for work, got dressed in a rush, threw on yesterday's pants, run out the door.  Sitting in a meeting, pants feel uncomfortable.  Reach inside, pull out yesterday's underwear which apparently I had just left inside pants when taking them off.  Now am sitting in meeting with handful of underwear and surrounded by horrified stares of coworkers.  **Panic**.  Put them back in.  <facepalm>

* Place drain stop in sink, add dish soap, turn on water, then go outside and mow lawn.  Walk back inside and feet go *splish*.  Entire first floor an inch deep in water.  <facepalm>

* Coworker tells funny story about time his wife rented a movie at video store, he accidentally returned it to a different one.  Me: "Haha, yeah... I've done that."  Him: "But you live *alone*, the hell do you return a movie to a different store than *you* rented it at?"  <facepalm>

* Work for same Fortune 500 company, getting ready for work in a rush again.  Arrive at work, start catching up on emails.  Rub side of face, "whoah, I forgot to shave this morning."  Rub other side of face "whoah, no I didn't."  Realize I shaved half my face, then... just... stopped.  <facepalm>
